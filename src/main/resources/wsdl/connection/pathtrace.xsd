                Attributes:

                id - In the case of TREE, this attribute contains the NSA
                identifier of the aggregator that performed path resolution,
                while for CHAIN, it is the identifier of the first (head-end)
                NSA allocating transport plane resources. This identifier is
                added for traceability back to the NSA performing initial
                path resolution.

                Elements:

                connectionId - Connection identifier for the reservation in the
                context of the NSA identified by the "id" attribute. This
                identifier is added for traceability to the originating reservation
                associated with this path.

                path - In the case of a "source" routing the NSA doing path
                resolution includes the complete path, while for “hop-by-hop”
                each NSA allocating data plane resources adds its path
                segment on the outbound reserve request until the full path is
                completed by the tail end NSA. This path element is used by
                uPA to perform routing policy enforcement.

                Attributes:

                id - The NSA identifier associated with this path segment.

                order - The sequence order of the connection in the overall
                path. As new segments are added to the path trace this value
                is increased by one over the last added segment.

                Elements:

                connectionId - Connection identifier for the reservation in the
                context of the NSA identified by the "id" attribute. This
                identifier is added for traceability to the uPA reservation
                associated with this path.

                stp - A list of STP identifier within this domain that are part
                of the overall path ordered by their sequence within the
                connection. This list will usually only contain ingress and
                egress STP, however, more flexibility is provided to model
                internal STP as well.
